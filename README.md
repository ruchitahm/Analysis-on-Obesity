Our data analytics tasks were:

Task 2: Psychological impact of obesity on people.
Task 3: Contribution of Obesity towards diabetes, health. Task 4: How to prevent obesity.
We performed our analysis on the datasets available on:
Google Dataset Search Engine: https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/


Firstly we installed NodeJS followed by installing Mongodb nodejs driver. The node driver allows us to easily interact with the MongoDB database from within the nodejs applications. We created our MongoDB database using the MongoDB Atlas, which is MongoDB fully managed database as a service.
We then created collections and clusters into the database to store our dataset data.

After successfully connecting to the database with the help of nodejs script, we created pipelines in the MongoDB Atlas to perform our required analysis on the data. JavaScript was used to display the outcome of data analysis tasks.
